# M.A.I.A_V1
# M.A.I.A (My AI Assistant) – Version 1

🚀 **My first ever AI project in Python!**  
M.A.I.A is a **beginner-friendly terminal-based AI assistant** powered by the **OpenRouter API** for AI text generation. This is **Version 1**, built while learning how AI connects with real applications using APIs.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 AI chat completions using OpenRouter (free model)
- ⚡ Real-time **streaming responses** in terminal
- 🧠 Manual **conversation memory** (chat history context)
- 🔐 Secure API key handling using **environment variables (.env)**
- 🌀 Background **spinner UX** using multithreading
- 🧩 Safe JSON parsing using `.get()` to prevent crashes
- 💬 Interactive loop (`exit` command supported)

---

## 🛠 Technologies / Libraries Used
- `Python` – Core language
- `OpenRouter API` – AI model access & streaming
- `requests` – HTTP API calls
- `dotenv` – Load environment variables securely
- `threading` – Run spinner in background
- `json` – Handle API request/response formatting
- `sys` – Terminal output control

---

## 📌 What I Learned
- How to integrate AI into apps using APIs
- Sending and receiving data in **JSON format**
- Importance of **not hardcoding sensitive credentials**
- Implementing **multithreading** for parallel terminal UX feedback
- Working with **streamed API response chunks**
- Managing conversation context manually
- Writing safer code using `.get()` to avoid runtime crashes

---

## 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Understanding **streaming vs normal API responses**
- Keeping terminal clean using overwrite (`\r`)
- Parsing live JSON chunks safely
- Maintaining conversation state manually

---

## 💡 Future Scope
This is **just V1**!  
Planned improvements include:
- Smarter conversation memory
- Better UI/UX for terminal output
- More AI models & custom personality tuning
- Possible upgrade to a web or mobile interface
